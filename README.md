# Applied NLP & LLM Mastery Journal

---

## üöÄ Introduction

This GitHub repository serves as my comprehensive learning journal for mastering **Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, with a strong emphasis on **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Generative AI**. My career aspiration is to become a highly competitive Applied NLP Engineer, building and integrating LLM-powered product features for leading companies such as Google, Amazon, OpenAI, and Anthropic. This repository meticulously documents my structured, hands-on learning path toward this goal.

My learning journey is highly hands-on and goal-oriented. I believe in understanding concepts by implementing them from scratch, experimenting with real-world problems, and incrementally building complex systems. This repository reflects that philosophy, providing practical code examples and detailed explanations that go beyond mere summaries. My aim is not just to learn, but to build a portfolio of demonstrable skills that will directly contribute to my specialization in LLMs and Generative AI.

## üìÇ Project Structure

This project adheres to a standard `cookiecutter-data-science` structure, ensuring a clean, organized, and scalable workflow. Key directories include:

* **`data/`**: Designated for both raw and processed data, supporting reproducibility.
* **`src/`**: Contains the primary source code, organized into self-contained Python modules for maintainability.
* **`notebooks/`**: Houses Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis, development, and documenting key learnings through code and explanations.
* **`scripts/`**: Reserved for production-ready scripts.
* **`tests/`**: Contains unit and integration tests to ensure code robustness.
* **`requirements.txt`**: Crucial for managing and installing all project dependencies using `pip`.

This structured approach facilitates collaboration, reproducibility, and maintainability throughout the learning and development process.

## üß† Key Learnings & Skills Demonstrated (Module 1: Deep Learning Fundamentals)

Module 1, "Deep Learning Fundamentals," has equipped me with a robust understanding of core deep learning concepts and practical proficiency in PyTorch. This foundational phase focused on building a strong base before delving into more advanced NLP and LLM topics. The key learnings and skills demonstrated include:

* **Proficiency with PyTorch Tensors:** I have gained a solid understanding of tensors as the fundamental building blocks in PyTorch. These highly optimized, multi-dimensional arrays are crucial for numerical computations, particularly when leveraging GPU acceleration. I understand that all inputs, outputs, and model parameters (like weights and biases) are represented as tensors, and I am proficient in using the `torch.Tensor` API for operations and interactive programming, similar to NumPy.
* **Understanding Automatic Differentiation (`torch.autograd`) & Relevant Calculus:** I've mastered PyTorch's `torch.autograd`, a core component that enables automatic differentiation, which is essential for efficiently calculating gradients. This mechanism is fundamental to the "learning from examples" process via gradient descent by automatically computing gradients throughout the computational graph. I understand that backpropagation is a specific method for computing gradients, categorized as a special case of reverse mode accumulation within automatic differentiation.
* **Implementation of Neural Network Building Blocks (Neurons, Layers, Activation Functions):** I've learned that deep learning relies on neural networks as mathematical entities that combine simpler functions to represent complex ones. My skills include utilizing PyTorch's `torch.nn` submodule to construct various neural network architectures using modules or layers. I can implement common components such as `nn.Linear` for affine transformations and have explored the foundational context through researching the history of the perceptron and multi-layer perceptrons.
* **Application of Loss Functions (MSE, Cross-Entropy) and Optimizers (SGD, Adam):** I can apply various loss functions from `torch.nn`, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross-Entropy loss, to compare model outputs with desired targets during training. Furthermore, I am skilled in using optimizers from PyTorch's `torch.optim` module, including Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam, to update model parameters and reduce prediction discrepancies.
* **Efficient Data Preparation using PyTorch's `Dataset` and `DataLoader`:** I've developed the ability to efficiently load and process data using PyTorch's powerful `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes. The `Dataset` class represents the data, while `DataLoader` instances are used to feed batches of samples to the model during training, supporting crucial functionalities like batching, shuffling, and multiprocessing for large datasets.
* **Execution of the Complete Neural Network Training Loop:** I am proficient in implementing a typical training loop in PyTorch as a standard Python `for` loop. This involves steps like evaluating the model on data, computing loss, and updating parameters. This includes setting up foundational training loops for classification models, incorporating metrics tracking (e.g., accuracy), and optimizing performance by running models on GPUs. I am also familiar with logging and displaying metrics, often using tools like TensorBoard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Running

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps to clone the repository, prepare your environment, install dependencies, and launch the Jupyter Notebooks.

1.  **Clone the Repository:** First, obtain the project code by cloning the GitHub repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Abhinav-SU/applied_nlp_llm_mastery.git](https://github.com/Abhinav-SU/applied_nlp_llm_mastery.git)
    cd applied_nlp_llm_mastery
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `Abhinav-SU` with your actual GitHub username).*

2.  **Set Up a Python Virtual Environment:** It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment to manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts with your system's Python installation.
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    * **On Windows (Command Prompt):** `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
    * **On Windows (PowerShell):** `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
    * **On macOS/Linux:** `source ./.venv/bin/activate`

4.  **Install Dependencies:** The project provides a `requirements.txt` file for managing and installing all necessary dependencies. Ensure your virtual environment is active before running this:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: If you plan to use TensorBoard for metrics tracking and visualization, you may also need to install `tensorflow` or `tensorboard` separately. The CPU-only package is sufficient if you are not using TensorFlow directly: `pip install tensorflow-cpu` or `pip install tensorboard`)*

5.  **Launch Jupyter Notebooks:** Once dependencies are installed, you can start the Jupyter Notebook server from the root directory of the project:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    Your default browser will then open, displaying a list of local notebook files, allowing you to explore the learning journal and code examples.
